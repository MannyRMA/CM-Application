PROJECT EXAMPLES
1) An academic Project I have recently particiapted in was the software development of a small 2D game in Java. The game was a skill based high input matching game that was inspired by Guitar Hero. 

My role for this project was one of the main technical developers. More specifically the developer for the graphics, UI, Frontend aspects of the project. I developed most of the graphics of the game such as: game board window, graphics for a falling musical note and helped in the development for the main menu. For the development of the graphics I used the JavaFx library. 

Along with the other main developer, I worked on important classes that were crucial to the backend aspect of the game such as the development of a class that generates the list of musical notes for a song from an input text file. Also helped in the completion of the development for the musical note class, a team member was having issues making a note appear on the game board, so I fixed the problem with them and explained to them why it was an issue. The JUnit test files for these two backend classes were written by me with the purpose of assuring the methods of the classes were working as expected and also get some practice writing test files.

2) Another academic project I have participated in was the software implementation of a Course Management System using Java. 

My main role for this project was frontend design and development. I worked on the design and implementation of the application windows to make them user friendly. I designed the manner in which we navigated through different pages/windows of the application. I implemented a simple search parser to enhance the user experience. The parser would would interpret an input for a user, perhaps a class they are interested in seeing the information, and if the class was in our database then the result would show the user how to get the information page of the class. Otherwise, it would tell the user the class was not found in our database.

I was also responsible for assuring that all the documentation for the iterations of the project were reported in time to our supervisor/professor and that every group member made their appropriate contributions. I had to contact a group member if the deadline was approaching and they hadn't contributed their part to the document, so that they could write their part in time before I had to report it to our professor. 

INSPIRATION


FOCUS

As seen by the project examples part of this document, for the academic projects I have participated in, the vast majority of my work involves frontend development. If I were given the time and resources to learn anything during my internship, it would be to work with more backend development. Learn and work with SQL to manage data with relational database management system. Recently I have been interested in learning more about MS Graph API and integrating developed products with Microsoft Services.

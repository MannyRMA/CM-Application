PROJECT EXAMPLES
1.	An academic Project I have recently participated in was the software development of a small 2D game in Java. The game was a skill based high input matching game that was inspired by Guitar Hero.

My role for this project was one of the main technical developers. More specifically the developer for the graphics, UI, Frontend aspects of the project. I developed most of the graphics of the game such as: game board window, graphics for a falling musical note and helped in the development for the main menu. For the development of the graphics I used the JavaFx library.
Along with the other main developer, I worked on important classes that were crucial to the backend aspect of the game such as the development of a class that generates the list of musical notes for a song from an input text file. Also helped in the completion of the development for the musical note class, a team member was having issues making a note appear on the game board, so I fixed the problem with them and explained to them why it was an issue. The JUnit test files for these two backend classes were written by me with the purpose of assuring the methods of the classes were working as expected and also get some practice writing test files.

2.	Another academic project I have participated in was the software implementation of a Course Management System using Java.

My main role for this project was frontend design and development. I worked on the design and implementation of the application windows to make them user friendly. I designed the way we navigated through different pages/windows of the application. I implemented a simple search parser to enhance the user experience. The parser would interpret an input for a user, perhaps a class they are interested in seeing the information, and if the class was in our database then the result would show the user how to get the information page of the class. Otherwise, it would tell the user the class was not found in our database.

I was also responsible for assuring that all the documentation for the iterations of the project were reported in time to our supervisor/professor and that every group member made their appropriate contributions. I had to contact a group member if the deadline was approaching and they hadn't contributed their part to the document, so that they could write their part in time before I had to report it to our professor.

INSPIRATION
1.	At the UCalgary Techfest I came across a project from Finger Food Advanced Technology Group that piqued my interest. The project/work they talked to me about was called EmbodyRelax. link: https://www.fingerfoodatg.com/lululemon-athletica/ They use Virtual Reality to help people reach a new level of mindfulness. For me personally, an important reason of why I chose computer science was because virtual reality and augmented reality technologies were new and were on the rise. I saw myself becoming a developer of these technologies as the number of implementations grows. I was inspired by their unique ability to use science to bring a virtual space into a physical/mental space. For example, in the video, they mention how the heart rate monitors are used to enhance the virtual space when an individual becomes more relaxed. As a person who values mindset and spirituality I was engrossed by this technology that brought 
together my values with virtual reality.

2.	I am also inspired by the rapid growth of e-commerce and how a well-developed web application or mobile application can help businesses increase their revenue. For example, Critical Mass' eCommerce Personalization for Blizzard Entertainment. I liked how the design and development of a new immersive store helped create more personalized experiences for the users. It had great success with a 57% increase in revenue, 7.5% increase in conversion and 56% increase in overall session duration (https://www.criticalmass.com/work/detail/blizzard). Seeing results like this where both the business and customers benefit from such work has encouraged me to work on the development of applications that serve as beneficial to the business as well as its customers. I also want to work on the design of a personalized application such as this one.

FOCUS

As seen by the project examples part of this document, for the academic projects I have participated in, most of my work involves frontend development. If I were given the time and resources to learn anything during my internship, I would choose to focus my efforts learning backend development in a professional environment. For example, to Learn and work with SQL to manage data with a relational database management system for a professional application. Using libraries such as socket IO to enable real time communication between a client and a server. This would really help me become a well-rounded developer for web-based applications.

he way I would spend my time learning backend development for a professional application would be to spend some time (about an hour) learning these new technologies and libraries reading their documentation and watching informational videos about them. Then go on to see examples, snippets of how the technology or library is being used for common applications. I would then use my new knowledge to look for ways on how I could implement the technologies into the project I would be working on.

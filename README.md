PROJECT EXAMPLES
1) An academic Project I have recently particiapted in was the software development of a small 2D game in Java. The game was a skill based high input matching game that was inspired by Guitar Hero. 
My role for this project was one of the main technical developers. More specifically the developer for the graphics, UI, Frontend aspects of the project. I developed most of the graphics of the game such as: game board window, graphics for a falling musical note and helped in the development for the main menu. For the development of the graphics I used the JavaFx library. Along with the other main developer, I worked on important classes that were crucial to the backend aspect of the game such as the development of a class that generates the list of musical notes for a song from an input text file. Also helped in the completion of the development for the musical note class, a team member was having issues making a note appear on the game board, so I fixed the problem with them and explained to them why it was an issue. The JUnit test files for these two backend classes were written by me with the purpose of assuring the methods of the classes were working as expected and also get some practice writing test files.
